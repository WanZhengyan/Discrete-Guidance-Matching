# Discrete Guidance Matching: Exact Guidance for Discrete Flow Matching

This repo contains the pytorch code for experiments in the paper Discrete Guidance Matching: Exact Guidance for Discrete Flow Matching

by Zhengyan Wan†, Yidong Ouyang†, Liyan Xie, Fang Fang, Hongyuan Zha, Guang Cheng.

We derive the exact transition rate for the desired distribution given a learned discrete flow matching model, leading to guidance that only requires
a single forward pass in each sampling step.
